# CS250Portfolio

This repo contains my final project retrospective as well as my Agile Presentation from my CS250 course on Agile, Fall 2021. 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
- In order to interpret user needs, a scrum team needs to have open communication with the client. They need to present 
  their software (a minimum viable product) to the clients/end users on a regular basis to make sure that they are on the 
  same page as the clients and get feedback both positive and negative in order to shape how the software develops
- Client/end user requirements are turned into "user stories" and added to the product backlog and this backlog is groomed
  during the sprint planning. These user stories help break down what needs to be done in a project in smaller bite-sized
  units and during each sprint the team decides how many user stories to work on and bring into that sprint to work on, and
  then at the end of the sprint a minimum viable product is presented to the client for feedback, which will further shape
  the grooming/changing/rearranging/removal of other stories from the product backlog.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- When I am developing programs, I employ a couple of important processes. One, I always read through and try my best to 
  deeply understand the requirements as well as the "why" behind the requirements, and ask questions as needed to understand
  what the client/end user wants and why they want those specific things, as well as it helps me rank how important each requirement
  is. I also sketch out some loose pseudocode to give me at least a big picture which is subject to change of how the code will flow.
  Another thing I do is test and develop the code in increments. I never write large blocks of code before testing, I test each method or object
  or element often and make sure that I at least have functioning code (even if it doesn't have all the requirements right off the bat) so that
  I have something to work with and build upon.
- In the future, I plan on using a sprint planning phase in my future development work, as well as even a smaller scale sprint/sprint review/retrospective
  type of method. I will plan out each sprint period, even if it's a smaller scale project, I'll try and set goals of "this is what I am going to work on
  and accomplish during this time period" and then after that time period is set I will go back and review and adjust accordingly and then repeat so that I can
  continue moving forward and stay more focused within a project (instead of procrastinating or getting sidetracked).
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- I'm learning that being a good teammate has more to do with the openness to learning, being collaborative and keeping communication open rather
  than knowing how to do everything/code perfectly. You can always collaborate and help each other out, but you at least have to have open dialog
  and keep your teammates informed of where you are at, what you are struggling with, and be open to mentoring or learning new things.
